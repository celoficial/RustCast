RustCast is a lightweight **DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) server**, written in **Rust**, that allows you to stream media from your computer to compatible devices, such as Smart TVs, speakers, and other devices.

## Roadmap

- [x] Device discovery via SSDP
- [x] Fetching device XML description
- [x] Media streaming (mp4, mkv, avi)
- [ ] Subtitle support
- [ ] Controls support
- [ ] Graphical user interface for end users

## Features üé•

- **Device discovery** via **SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol)**.
- **Media streaming** to DLNA/UPnP-compatible devices.
- Integration with TVs and other devices.
- Open-source code under the **Apache 2.0 license**.

## Requirements üîß

- **Rust** (version 1.70 or later)
- DLNA/UPnP-compatible devices

## Installation üì•

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/celoficial/RustCast.git
cd RustCast
```

### 2. Configure the environment

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the variables:

```env
HTTP_PORT=8080
DLNA_FRIENDLY_NAME=RustCast
MULTICAST_ADDRESS=239.255.255.250
MULTICAST_PORT=1900
```

### 3. Build the project

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### 4. Run the project

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Demo üöÄ

### Example Output

After running the software, you will see something like this in the terminal:

```bash
Starting the DLNA Server: RustCast
Starting HTTP server on port 8080
UDP Socket created at: Ok(192.168.0.97:50980)
Sending SSDP request to 239.255.255.250:1900...
Discovered MediaRenderer devices:
1) http://192.168.0.109:9197/dmr
Select a device by its number (or type '0' to exit):
Media files found:
1) Video.mp4
Choose a media file by number (or type '0' to exit):
Connection configured successfully!
Playback started successfully!
Streaming completed successfully!
```

After selecting a device and media file, the software connects and streams media!

## How It Works

RustCast uses the following protocols and technologies:

1. **SSDP** for discovering devices on the local network.
2. **HTTP** for communication and control with DLNA devices.
3. **Rust** for security, speed, and reliability.
4. **UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)** for device control and integration.
